<h1>APTSUR - A Multi-STA Surrogate</h1>

APTSUR is a simple custom surrogate that spawns some number of
STA threads to service activation requests that come into the surrogate's
MTA. Structurally, it is similar to the OLEAPT SDK sample, except that 
it runs in a surrogate.

<p>Feel free to check out this code. Be aware that I wrote it one evening 
on a dare and as such, it has not been throroughly tested. If you find an 
error, please check back to this page and if the bug has not been
registered, please send me mail 
(<a HREF="mailto:dbox@develop.com">dbox@develop.com</a>).

<h2>Cool things in this code</h2>
If you register aptsur.exe with a command line argument, you can set the
number of STA threads that are used to create objects: <br><br>
<tt>
DllSurrogate=C:\aptsur.exe -threads:50
</tt><br>


<h2>Known Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>If CoCreateInstance fails the first time, the surrogate does not
shut down. I couldn't come up with a <i>reliable</i> way to deal with this 
problem, although I have some ideas. The trick is you need to detect
if there are live instances. This is not possible today. <br><b>This bug is now 
fixed. Look at the CClassObjectWrapper::CreateInstance method for details
on how this was fixed!</b>
</ul>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>I always forward activation requests to an STA. If the DLL is 
ThreadingModel = Free, then it actually gets activated back in the MTA
anyway. If the DLL is ThreadingModel=Both, then, unfortunately, the 
DLL gets stuck in an STA, not in the MTA where it probably belongs.
<li>I am a bit rude in terminating the process before all threads 
get a chance to shutdown. I tried syncronously tearing down the 
STA threads, but wound up with a deadlock I didn't have time to debug.
In theory, if we get a FreeSurrogate, then the STA threads should 
be idle anyway.
</ul>
